					<h4>Love This Highlight</h4>
					<h5>Written By: Jade2405</h5>
					<p>The era of Cain is here. This highlight shows everything he's accomplished in his time in the UFC. I especially loved how the video showed Cain losing the title to Junior Dos Santos. Most highlight videos don't show the highlighted fighter losing, but this one was brave and decided to show it. I like the honesty - but they know Cain isn't going anywhere for a while. #WARCAIN</p>

					<h4>Great Video</h4>
					<h5>Written By : submissi0nExpert</h5>
					<p>This video was great. Showed all the important parts of Cain's career so far. The video was a little short though, wished it show a little more footage. The music was perfect.</p>
